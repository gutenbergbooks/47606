<h2>THE THIRTY-ONE-AND-SIXPENNY
DREADFUL.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own High-Class Police
News Reporter.</i>)</p>

<p>At the Grosvenor Square Criminal Court
the case of Lady <span class="smcap">d'Edbroke</span> came on for
hearing at the head of the list. Interest in
this alleged crime in high life drew together
a vast galaxy of Society women, and His
Worship was with difficulty accommodated
with a seat on the bench. Opera-glasses ruled
from one-and-sixpence-in-the-slot. The
first charge brought against her ladyship was
that of refusing alimony to her husband. A
second dealt with the desertion of her children.</p>

<p>The prosecution undertook to prove that Sir
<span class="smcap">Benedick</span> had been found at night on the
doorstep of the d'Edbroke Mansion without a
latchkey or other visible means of subsistence.
Lady <span class="smcap">d'Edbroke</span> (<i>née</i> <span class="smcap">Swag</span>) was described
as the daughter of a wealthy
Birmingham manufacturer of antiques. By
her marriage into the ancient and honourable
house of the <span class="smcap">d'Edbrokes</span> she had relieved the
fortunes of the three-and-twentieth baronet,
whose assets at the moment had been <i>nil</i>.
Two children had been born of the marriage,
and these had recently been discovered in a
state of emaciation in a Park Lane <i>crèche</i>.</p>

<p>Counsel would call her ladyship's maid to
give evidence of the kind of literature to
which her mistress had been addicted. That
domestic would admit that she (the domestic),
being bored by the feeble and fatuous
character of the Penny Dreadful as a guide
to immorality, had been in the habit of
utilizing her mistress's left-off thirty-one-and-sixpenny
and other expensive shockers.
He hoped to show that this class of work,
though not above the level of the Penny
Dreadful in point of literary qualities, was of
a mere seductive piquancy. At the time of
the prisoner's arrest her drawing-room and
boudoir were littered with printed matter,
from the titles of which he would select four
specimens: <i>A Melodrama of Spasms</i>, <i>The
Superfluous Male</i>, <i>A Neo-Platonic Passion</i>,
<i>An Edenless Adam</i>. From the last of these
he ventured to read an extract or two, in the
selection of which he had been assisted by
the pencil marks and marginal comments of
the prisoner. The book, he might add, was
from a lending library.</p>

<p>"A veritable Dian, flame-red with the
shame of maternity, the young mother of
twins faced her cowed and miserable husband.
Mentally she threw up the sponge ready for
the next round, for she had still a shot in her
locker with which to run a mucker."</p>

<p>Council here explained that the writer, a
simple woman, was still feeling her way in
the use of sporting language.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">James</span>,' she said, 'I was an ignorant girl
when I married you for your wealth, you me
for my beauty of soul. There I thought that
the bargain had ended. How was I to know
that women have a tendency to bear children?
No one ever pointed out to me any precedent
for this. In my innocence it had never
occurred to me that I might myself have been
originally born.'"</p>

<p>Here a Juror intervened to request that
he might, as a family man, be allowed to
retire. Leave being refused, he then asked
if ladies ought to listen to such extracts.
His Worship thereupon ordered all decent
women to leave the court. No one moved,
and the extract was resumed.</p>

<p>"'And now, in the full pride of my sexlessness,
I have had a painful fall. I am branded
with the mark of servitude. The laughing-stock
of my emancipated sisters, I shall go
down to posterity as <i>a mother!</i>'</p>

<p>"Lord <span class="smcap">James</span> winced. The mother of twins
continued.</p>

<p>"'Had mine been the wealth and yours the
beauty of soul&mdash;and of this you can never
have even been suspected&mdash;my course would
be plain. I should, by the right of the
Married Women's Impropriety Act, banish
you from this house. Never should you
darken these doors again, though you might
linger on the doorstep, an Edenless <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, a
worm, a periwinkle at the gate of Paradise!
As it is, being compelled from lack of filthy
lucre to tolerate existence under your roof,
I insist that these signs of my degradation'&mdash;here
she pointed defiantly at the twins,
who howled&mdash;'be kept for ever from my eyes
under the tutelage of hired menials, in a
nursery with padded walls to be built out
over the billiard-room. Otherwise I propose
to leave you and become a <i>Tableau Vivant!</i>'"</p>

<p>At this point the usher rebuked applause in
the galleries.</p>

<p>A second extract ran as follows:&mdash;"A year
later, in the height of the season at Battersea
Park, a remarkable tandem was the object of
universal comment. It consisted of Lord and
Lady <span class="smcap">James</span>, or, more strictly, Lady and Lord
<span class="smcap">James</span>, for Lady <span class="smcap">James</span> steered from the
front, clad in high collar, starched shirt,
breeches and gaiters, while Lord <span class="smcap">James</span> followed
in a blouse and divided skirt, doing
all the work. A symbol this of the conditions
under which he was now admitted to the privilege
of communion with her. That the
man should be compelled to do the work, itself
a mark of serfdom, was but one of many conditions
laid down by the predominant partner.
Another was that he should not offend decency
by appearing in the recognised costume of a
woman. Hence the blouse and divided skirt,
lately relegated to male use."</p>

<p>Here His Worship observed that this extract
failed to bear upon the issue, and it was then
shown that the pencil-mark, with the comment
"Good again!" was the work of another subscriber
to <span class="smcap">Mudie's</span>. A third extract, taken
from a new book of the Six-Shilling-Shocker
series&mdash;<i>A Melodrama of Spasms</i>&mdash;began:
"I am glad that these sins of your magenta
breeding are no irony of fate." The foreman
of the jury demanded an elucidation, which
Counsel was unable to produce. Court still
working at enigma when report left.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">A Hyde-ous Danger.</span>&mdash;"Hyde Park"

<i>Mr. P.</i> summons First Commissioner of
Works, Commissioner of Police, and "<span class="smcap">George
Ranger</span>," who, he believes, has not yet retired
from this office, to step out at once and
do their duty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">New Style&mdash;in the Future.</span> <span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Interior of the Council Chamber
at the War Office. Committee of National Defence in Consultation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Member.</i> Well, really, I think the troops should advance.</p>

<p><i>Second Member.</i> Certainly, but how about their uniforms?</p>

<p><i>Third Member.</i> Oh, I am responsible for that department.
Everything fairly well. At least, I think so.</p>

<p><i>1st M.</i> Oh, if you only "think so," we had better break off for a while.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The Committee "break off for a while" and then reassemble.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>3rd M.</i> Now everything's right. I thought there was some
trouble about the new forage caps. Well, the difficulty has been
surmounted, and all is as correct as can be.</p>

<p><i>1st M.</i> Pleased to hear it. Ammunition up to the mark?</p>

<p><i>4th M.</i> That's <i>my</i> special department. It may be, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>3rd M.</i> Oh! Don't you think we had better adjourn a bit?</p>

<p><i>1st M.</i> Why, certainly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They "adjourn a bit," then reassemble.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>4th M.</i> Glad I had an opportunity of looking into the affair.
Fact is, although we had a lot of cordite, there was certainly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>1st M.</i> Yes, I know. But is it all right now?</p>

<p><i>4th M.</i> Right! Of course! It never was wrong, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>1st M.</i> Quite so. Don't let's waste time. How about the transport?</p>

<p><i>5th M.</i> I am responsible for that. If you really want to move
the troops any distance, perhaps I had better&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>1st M.</i> It's very annoying! but as you say "you had better" do
something or other, let's scatter for a time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They "scatter for a time," and reassemble.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>5th M.</i> Lucky I overhauled my department. If I hadn't you
wouldn't have been able to move the troops a dozen yards.</p>

<p><i>1st M.</i> But is it all right now? Equipment, ammunition, transport?
Are you all right?</p>

<p><i>Chorus.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><i>1st M.</i> (<i>through telephone</i>). Quick, march!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The troops are moved.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Style&mdash;in the Past.</span> <span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Anywhere in front of an Army.</i></p>

<p><i>Commander-in-Chief.</i> I vouch for everything! I have only to
give the word of command. Quick, march!</p>

<h2>THE JOLLY YOUNG WATERMAN.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Up to Date.</i>)</p>

<p>
And did you not hear of the East London Watermen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who our requirements failed to supply,</span><br />
If the weather was hot or was cold in severity<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their pipes and their cisterns were equally dry.</span><br />
In cold or in heat they charged as steadily,<br />
But water to drink we couldn't get readily;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet water or none, with an impudent air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They charged all the same, and it didn't seem fair.</span><br />
<br />
What sights of distress there were seen in the district,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its drains were unflushed, and were tainted withal,</span><br />
(There was always a cause&mdash;some "Progressive" obstruction,)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the party supporting them grew very small;</span><br />
And often would there be both swearing and sneering,<br />
But 'twas all one to them the complaining and jeering;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For cursing and praying they little did care&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But charged us for water&mdash;it didn't seem fair.</span><br />
<br />
But, only to fancy how strangely things happen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While rates were collected for nothing at all,</span><br />
The Government Board held a special inquiry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which sat for a while in the Hackney Town Hall.</span><br />
And should this report (to the Company's sorrow)<br />
Be issued to-day, next month, or to-morrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The East London Company'd better take care&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As charging for nothing is scarcely quite fair.</span><br />

<h2>SKETCHES FROM SCOTLAND.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">At the Drumquhidder Highland Gathering.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A meadow near Drumquhidder, South Perthshire, where
the annual Highland Games are being held. The programme
being a long one, there are generally three events being contested
in various parts of the ground at the same time. On the
benches immediately below the Grand Stand are seated two
Drumquhidder worthies</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Parritch</span> <i>and</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Havers</span>, <i>with</i>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">McTavish</span> <i>and her niece, two acquaintances from Glasgow,
to whom they are endeavouring&mdash;not altogether successfully&mdash;to
make themselves agreeable</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Havers</i> (<i>in allusion to the dozen or so of drags, landaus, and
waggonettes on the ground</i>). There's a number o' machines hier the
day, Messis <span class="smcap">McTarvish</span>, an' a wonderfu' crood; there'll be a bit
scarceness ower on yon side, but a gey many a'thegither. I conseeder
we're est awfu' forrtunate in the day an' a'.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Mrs. <span class="smcap">McTavish</span> <i>assents, but without enthusiasm</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Parritch.</i> I've jist ben keekin' into the Refraishmen' Tent.
It's an awfu' peety they're
no pairmeetin' ony intoaxicans&mdash;naethin'
but non-alcohoalic
liquors an' sic like, an'
the hawm-sawndwiches no
verra tender. (<i>With gallantry.</i>)
What do ye say, noo,
Messis <span class="smcap">McTarvish</span>&mdash;wull ye
no come an' tak' a bite wi'
me?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. McTavish</i> (<i>distantly</i>).
Ah'm no feelin' able for't jist

<p><i>Mr. Parr.</i> Ye'll hae a
boatle o' leemonade at my expense?
Ye'll no? Then ye

I'd pit the quaistion. (<i>To a

An' hoo's a' wi' ye, Mester
<span class="smcap">McKerrow</span>? Ye're a member
o' the Cawmittee, I obsairve,

a bet row wi' ye.</p>

<p><i>Mr. McKerrow</i> (<i>unconcernedly</i>).
Then ye'll jist to

What's wrang the noo?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Parr.</i> I'd like to ask
ye if ye conseeder it fair or
jest to charrge us tippence

<p><i>Mr. McKerr.</i> I'm no responsible
for 't; but, if <i>I</i>'d
ben there, I'd ha' chairged ye
twa shellins; sae ye'd better say nae mair aboot the maitter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Mr. <span class="smcap">Parritch</span> <i>does not pursue the subject</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Havers</i> (<i>as a detachment of the Black Watch Highlanders

the Block Wetch hier the day. Man, they gie us a colour! It's
verra pretty hoo nicely they can pairforrm the drill.... An' noo

<p><i>Mr. McKerr.</i> (<i>contradictiously</i>). The sporran does na hairrt them
at a'.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Havers.</i> Man, it's knockin' against them at every stride they
tak'. (<i>His attention wanders to a Highland Fling, which three
small boys are dancing on a platform opposite.</i>) He's an awfu'
bonnie dauncer that wee laddie i' the meddle!</p>

<p><i>Mr. McKerr.</i> Na sae awfu' bonnie, he luiks tae much at his

<p><i>Mr. Parr.</i> Yon grup-luikin' tyke? I canna thenk it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Havers.</i> Na, it'll be yon bald-heided man in broon. He's
verra enthusiastic. He's ben rinnin' in a' the races, I obsairve.
"<span class="smcap">Smeth</span>" did ye say his neem was? (<i>To</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, <i>pawkily</i>.)
Ye'll hae an affaictionate regaird for thet neem, I'm thenking, Mess

<p><i>Miss Rose</i> (<i>with maidenly displeasure</i>). 'Deed, an I'm no unnerstanding

<p><i>Mr. Havers.</i> They'll be begenning the wrustling oot yon in the

<p><i>Mr. McKerr.</i> It'll be the

<p><i>Mr. Havers.</i> Ye say that because he has a' them gowd maidles

<h2>MR. BRIEFLESS IS INTERVIEWED.</h2>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, Sir," said my admirable and excellent
clerk <span class="smcap">Portington</span>, a few days since, as I was looking through the
circulars that had accumulated on my table in Chambers during the
earlier portion of the long vacation.</p>

<p>"A client?" I queried.</p>

<p>"No, Sir, I think not," was the reply, supplemented with a card
placed on my desk. "At least, I do not
remember the name in your fee-book."</p>

<p>"You do not believe he has called on
any errand of an unpleasant character?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Sir!&mdash;the rates have been in
for a fortnight. If I might hazard a suggestion,
I should say he was a literary
gentleman."</p>

<p>I smiled, but was a little uncertain as to
the better course of action. No doubt the
man of letters was seeking an interview
with a view to its subsequent reproduction.
I am not altogether in favour of these
public betrayals of private affairs, but considered
that there could be no harm in this
instance if I consented to see the journalistic
intruder. To tell the truth, of
late&mdash;much to my annoyance&mdash;reports have
been in circulation rather prejudicial to my
pecuniary credit. I am not a rich man.
In these hard times who is? But for all that I am able to keep the
wolf from the door, and maintain a position not derogatory to the
status of barrister-at-law. It occurred to me, as I requested <span class="smcap">Portington</span>
to admit the visitor, that perhaps the meeting might lead to
satisfactory results. If the caller happened to be an interviewer, I
might "inspire" him.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<a href="images/185-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/185-1.png" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">A. Briefless</span>, Jun., I think," said the new comer, as he seated
himself in a chair and referred to a pocket-book. I bowed. "This
is not your private address&mdash;these are your chambers?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I returned; "but perhaps, before we go further, you
will be so good as to tell me what you want?"</p>

<p>"Well, briefly, a statement of your affairs for the last three
years. I will not trouble you for anything of an earlier date."</p>

<p>I again inclined my head. I was not altogether pleased with my
visitor's manner. He was certainly abrupt, and he adopted a tone of
authority that jarred upon my nerves. Possibly he wished to give the
account of our interview to our cousins across the Atlantic. If this
were so, I need not be over-scrupulous in my statements. Americans
are accustomed to the rouge of exaggeration on the cheek of
fact. So I would convey a false impression if I omitted, so to
speak, the magnifying cosmetic.</p>

<p>"You do not propose to make public anything in this country?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly not," he replied. "All you say will be treated confidentially,
save with the necessary exceptions."</p>

<p>I was satisfied. Of course the exceptions would be the people in the
Republic of the West. I told him that my practice was a large one.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" As it struck me that the exclamation savoured of
surprise, I thought it advisable to repeat the statement with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Yes," I continued, "there are many of my brethren at the Bar,
better known to the world than I am, who would be pleased to change
places with me. Because my name does not appear very frequently
in the newspapers you must not imagine that I am idle. On the
contrary, my chamber practice is immense&mdash;distinctly immense."</p>

<p>"Really," he murmured, and then mentioned the names of
two or three of my learned friends whose incomes were decidedly
considerable, and asked me if I deemed my practice equal to theirs.</p>

<p>"You put me in rather a delicate position," I returned with a
smile. "Of course, I do not know the exact amount of the takings
of the gentlemen to whom you have referred, but personally, I should
consider my own practice more lucrative than theirs."</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>do</i> know their receipts," said my interviewer, "so I can
estimate yours. Thank you very much. And now is there any
other source of income omitted? Have you houses or shops, or anything
of that sort?"</p>

<p>"As a barrister, I am prevented from trading," I replied, again
with hauteur. And then I continued: "I am afraid you take
too deep an interest in the commercial side of my career. What you
should wish to learn, as my introducer to the American public, is my
opinion on matters of the day. Now, for instance, I believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interrupted my visitor, rather brusquely. "But
you have told me all I desire to know."</p>

<p>I bowed, and then I asked in what publication I might expect to
see the interview.</p>

<p>"See the interview!" exclaimed the caller. "What interview?"</p>

<p>"Why," I explained, rather angrily, "the interview between you
and me. You are a journalist, are you not?"</p>

<p>"A journalist! Certainly not! What made you think that?"</p>

<p>"Then, Sir," I cried, indignantly, "what right had you to force
yourself into my presence, and waste my time in asking a number of
useless, and, I may add, impertinent questions?"</p>

<p>"I had the right, and the questions were neither useless nor
impertinent."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, Sir."</p>

<p>"With pleasure;" and then he added, with a smile that did not
provoke its fellow on my own countenance, "you must know that I
am an assessor of income tax!"</p>

<p>Comment would be superfluous!</p>

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Blackwood</span> have got as far as <i>Felix Holt</i> in the re-publication
in popular form of the works of <span class="smcap">George Eliot</span>. It would be
interesting to know how the venture has fared with the popular
fancy for which it was designed. It
is said young men and maidens of the
present date cannot read the <span class="smcap">Charles
Dickens</span> whose books enthralled their
fathers and mothers. How does
<span class="smcap">George Eliot</span>, who in her day held
a position with the novel-reading
public second only to <span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>,
withstand the changes of fancy
and fashion? My Baronite has been
trying the experiment on himself by
reading again, after the lapse of
many years, <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>.
He reports that he finds the first
volume flag a little, by reason of the
minute record of childhood's troubles
and schoolday tasks. But in the second volume, where the tragedy
of love is worked out with surpassing power and infinite skill, the
old spell is woven again. <i>The Mill on the Floss</i> is certainly one
of the best of <span class="smcap">George Eliot's</span> novels, being completed before the
malign influence of schoolmaster <span class="smcap">George Henry Lewes</span> made itself
felt. To this extent, it is not a fair test of the problem suggested.
But the collection as a whole is rich in value. In "the Standard
edition" Messrs. <span class="smcap">Blackwood</span> present it in daintiest form, and at a
marvellously cheap price.</p>



<p><i>The Shoulder of Shasta</i> is not a new joint from an entirely new
animal, as those who are tired of "the Shoulder of Mutton" may be
sorry to hear; but, it is a charming romance, in one volume, written
by <span class="smcap">Bram Stoker</span> at his best. The heroine's name is "<i>Esse</i>"; and the
whole interest of the story lies in the question, "<i>Esse</i> or <i>non Esse</i>"&mdash;"to
be or not to be" the wife of "<i>Mr. Dick</i>." For there is a "<i>Mr.
Dick</i>"&mdash;not in any way related to <span class="smcap">Dickens's</span> "<i>Mr. Dick</i>,"&mdash;who
is a kind of Buffalo Bill among the Indians. There is a <i>Miss Gimp</i>,
a governess, whose peculiarities certainly do recall those of <i>Mrs.
Nickleby</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bram Stoker's</span> plot is a <i>boîte à surprise</i>, and yet a
most simple and natural story. Go to your butcher's and order <i>The
Shoulder of Shasta</i>, to be served up "<i>à la</i> <span class="smcap">Stoker</span>." N.B.&mdash;For
"butcher's" read "bookseller's"; 'tis published by "A Constable"
who "knows what subjects to take up," says the thoughtful</p>

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p>I am at Davos. Be careful about the pronunciation:
put the accent broadly on the
second syllable, and you have it. With me,
if I may say so, it is a case of <i>Davos non
vobis</i>, for I have come here not for my own
health, but to act as travelling-companion to
one of the best fellows in the world, who
seeks health and strength in this quiet and
beautiful valley. God be with him, and
with all his fellow-sufferers here. Here are
some notes taken on the way.</p>

<p><i>Hall of the Grosvenor Hotel, 10.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></i>&mdash;A
mixed crowd of anxious French and
English people: a sprinkling of Americans.
Desperate inquiries from an elderly French
lady for her box. A moment ago the box
was visible, a monumental box peacefully
reposing near the door. Now it has vanished.
Is the box to be added to the questions pending
between France and England? No; it
is found&mdash;on a truck. The French Ambassador
may rest in peace. On a sofa reclines
a magnificent Arab, tall, stately, bronzed,
aquiline, robed in a waving burnous and a
turban of dazzling white. How he casts our
puny, ditto-suited, cloth-capped civilisation
into the shade. An almost irresistible impulse
comes over me to change my ticket,
break every tie and make a dash with him
for his native desert, to live a free and untrammelled
life, to head a successful insurrection
against the French oppressor, to be
laid after death in a splendid tomb with a
cupola amidst the lamentations of thousands
of lithe and dusky warriors.</p>

<p><i>11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></i>&mdash;We are off; handshakings, wavings
of handkerchiefs. Still dreaming of
Algeria, I am recalled to actuality by a stoppage
at Herne Hill.</p>

<p><i>Calais.</i>&mdash;The home of the <i>demi-poulet</i>, not
forgetting the <i>flageolet</i>. Perpetual entrances
of imperturbable officials with chorus "<i>Les
voyageurs pour....</i>" Consequent series of
shocks inimical to quiet eating. At last our
turn comes. Each of us has bagged a <i>demi-poulet</i>
in record time. Why all this hurry?
At any rate we are off.</p>

<p><i>Laon, 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></i>&mdash;Dinner. English traveller
wants whisky. "<i>Avez vous doo visky?</i>"
Lady of restaurant shakes her head. "<i>Visky
Ecossais. Eau de vie Ecossais.</i>" A brilliant
inspiration, but the landlady, protesting she
can supply <i>eau de vie</i>, denies all knowledge
of the Scotch variety. "Perhaps," says a
helpful old lady, an English fellow-traveller,
looking at the tariff-board on which the word
"<i>rhum</i>" figures, "perhaps they call it
'room.'" Suggestion received with enthusiasm:
"<i>Avez vous doo room?</i>" Enter
guard: "<i>Les voyageurs pour Bâle.</i>" Only
just time to pay. Off we go again.</p>

<p><i>Bâle, 5.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></i>&mdash;Train stops: consultation
of watches. Can't be Bâle: not due till 6.30.
Another hour for sleep; turn over, when
door opens suddenly and an alarmed Swiss
porter ejaculates "<i>Mais deshendez donc,
Monsieur, le drain fa bartir</i>." Out we go:
the sky becomes dark with hats, sticks,
wraps, handbags. Have we got everything?
Yes&mdash;no&mdash;where is my waistcoat? Quite
forgot I had discarded it at night: it contains
watch, money, everything. Approach of
beaming porter carrying waistcoat like a
banner. Transference of silver from self to
porter. He beams more and more. Unduly
early arrival explained by fact that we are now
under Central European time. Breakfast.</p>

<p>At Bâle I purchase the Paris <i>Temps</i> of
to-day's date. An article on the Swiss Referendum.
At last I am at close quarters with
the Referendum. Question for decision was,
is the sale of matches to be a State monopoly?
The Swiss voter has said no by an overwhelming
majority. The <i>Temps</i>, analysing results,
sees in this "a victory of the individualist
spirit, and of French tradition over the German
spirit instilled in the universities of
Zurich, Berne, and Bâle, or brought home
by Swiss writers and politicians who have
studied in Germany itself." Sédan is avenged.
It appears, too, that the Swiss voter is getting
bored with Referendums. He has had too
many of them, and on this occasion barely
half of him recorded his vote. Merry Swiss
voter, awaking on a Sunday morning, inquires
of his merry Swiss wife, "Any voting
to-day, my dear?" "Only those silly
matches," replies M. S. W. "Oh, drat they
matches," says merry Swiss voter (or words
to that effect). "I'm not going to trouble
about <i>that</i>," and turns over to sleep again.
Anyhow, matches are not to be a State
monopoly. Long live the Referendum!</p>

<p><i>On the way to Landquart.</i>&mdash;Sudden alarm
of my companion. He clutches my arm, and
points to the roof of railway carriage, saying,
in an awe-struck voice, "What does that
mean; why do they put that word there?"
Following with my eyes the direction of his
finger, I notice white dial, with moveable
hand, let into roof. Plainly painted in bold
letters on one side of the dial is the word
"hell." On the other side, however, I see
the German word "dunkel," which, of
course, makes things clear. Quite natural,
though, that apparatus for turning light up
and down should, at first sight, be mistaken
for a Salvation Army warning.</p>

<p><i>Landquart, 1.16 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></i>&mdash;Lunch. Here the toy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
railway to Davos begins. We have still more than 3000 feet to climb
before reaching our destination. Obtain beautifully-coloured little
pamphlet with map. Learn that we are about to travel on "highest
adhesion railway in Europe." Prepare ourselves to be as adhesive as
possible by taking in immense amount of ballast in the shape of lunch.
On consulting map, presumably drawn to scale, find that Davos is at
least five times the size of London, which figures minutely in upper
left-hand corner. This is delightful. Delight, however, dashed
by observing that the distance from Landquart to Davos is nearly
three times as great as from London to Bâle. Still, after the shock
of finding ourselves under Central European time, we are prepared
for most things. At last the little toy engine puffs violently,
metaphorically takes off its coat, and, like <i>Mr. Snodgrass</i>,
announces in a very loud tone that it is going to begin. We start!
Hurrah, we adhere!!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Up, up, and still up we climb, hanging on here and there by our
eyebrows to mountain precipices, and peering down into chasms on
the other side. Still we adhere and the gallant little engine puffs
away like mad. Amiable Swiss guard takes a paternal pride in it,
in the train, in the scenery, and (after usual transference of silver)
in us. Have we ever been at Davos before? No? In that case, it
appears, we must prepare for pleasures before which the overrated
amusements of Paris and Vienna pale and dwindle. Davos at last.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Davos.</i>&mdash;Wonderfully hearty reception at the Hôtel d'Angleterre.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Demmer</span> smiles, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Demmer</span> smiles, the boots, the waitress,
the housemaid all smile. We smile, too, and find everything prepared
in rooms of the most brilliant cleanness: dinner, and so to bed.</p>

<p>Conversation in Davos is of great simplicity. We are all either invalids
or the friends of invalids. At first hearing it would appear as
if a gigantic ball, at which nobody danced, was perpetually taking
place. "Have you been sitting out much to-day?" "Yes, I sat
out nine hours." "Ah, I only managed to get in seven," &amp;c., &amp;c.
For the pure and perfect air is the main element of the cure at Davos,
and in nearly all weathers the invalids are on the verandahs drawing
in these draughts of new life and vigour.</p>

<p>On the following morning I stroll. Remember that, curiously
enough, I haven't seen a single soldier since I arrived in Switzerland.
Here, however, is a photographic group of non-commissioned officers
of the Davos section of some infantry regiment. All their implements
of warfare are drawn, a martial defiance gleams from every
eye. In the centre of the group two of the most warlike cross their
protecting swords in front of a tall lady, allegorically attired in
cloak and scale-armour to represent Helvetia. I immediately
abandon contemplated invasion and annexation of Switzerland.</p>

<p>A band is playing under an arcade of glass in front of the
<i>Kurhaus</i>. They play really admirably&mdash;as good a band, as I have
heard for a long time. But they are all, to a flute, dressed in black
frock-coats, tightly buttoned, and black top-hats, for all the world
like a provincial British municipality out for a holiday. Everything,
save for the band, is wonderfully peaceful. A few cows browse
in the valley, their pleasant bells drowsily tinkling. The surrounding
mountains have donned their white crowns in our honour: the
snowy, silent peaks glitter in the brilliant sun. In front of our
hotel a retriever puppy, with an imperfect control over his paws,
engages in a romp with a little white dog. He bowls over the
little white dog, and, before he has quite recovered from the shock,
bowls him over again. This is too much for the white dog's dignity:
he bites the retriever violently in a tender part of the back. Woe,
woe, the game is over, and the puppy flies homeward. In the afternoon
the colony sits out again; it sits out finally after dinner. And
so the quiet days proceed, for the time of toboggans and skates is not
yet. It is a peaceful, a delightful spot, and on every hand are to be
met hale and hearty folk who drifted hither, derelict wrecks, to be
towed into haven and made sound for many a voyage. The tales of
complete cures vary the conversational record of hours of sitting out.
St. Luke, the good physician, is the patron saint of the little English
Church here, and might well be the patron saint of Davos itself.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">A Council of War.</span>&mdash;The pugnacity which tradition tells us was
the chief characteristic of the Kilkenny Cat Conferences finds a
parallel in a recent meeting of Aberdare District Councillors, at
which, among other compliments, such as members bluntly accusing
each other of falsehood, the chairman advised a counsellor to go to
the &mdash;&mdash; gentleman whose name is usually omitted in polite converse.
The seconder of a motion proposed by a Justice of the Peace, had the
following remarkable and withering invective hurled at him from
the chair: "You know <i>nothing</i> about it, Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span> knows but
little, and <i>you know less</i>," while another counsellor observed, "I
should show at least that I had a little brains." This gentleman is
to be congratulated upon his consciousness of superior cerebral
strength, and if the council possesses but "little brains" this deficiency
is amply supplied by a corresponding wealth of choler and a
copious flow of wrathful language.</p>

<h2>"BONNIE DUNDEE."</h2>

<div class="figleft w50">
<a href="images/192.png"><img width="100%" src="images/192.png" alt="" /></a>
<p class="center">Bonnie Dun-dee!</p>
</div>

<p>There was something exceedingly pretty in the doings at Dundee
the other day when the burghers assembled to do honour to their
old Member Mr. <span class="smcap">Armitstead</span>. In the Parliament of 1880-5 Mr.
<span class="smcap">Armitstead's</span> commanding presence was a familiar and welcome
feature. Since then, having piloted Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> in successive
journeys about the continent,
his personality has
obtained a wider field of
recognition. When, at
Biarritz and elsewhere, the
population, tracking Mr.
<span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, came upon this
tall, straight figure, with
flowing beard and kindly
honest eyes, they thought
he must be the Grand Old
Man of whom they had heard
so much. They, it is said,
cheered him accordingly,
leaving Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> free
from embarrassing attention. That is probably a fable. Certainly,
in Dundee, where Mr. <span class="smcap">Armitstead</span> lived and worked for forty years,
there is no chance of his being mistaken for any other G. O. M.
Having retired from public life, Dundee wanted to have a portrait of
its most honoured citizen. That was very nice, but as acceptance of
the suggestion would have involved his presence at the installation
of the portrait, and the making of a speech in response to all the
kind things said, Mr. <span class="smcap">Armitstead</span> modestly shrank from the ordeal.
But he managed, after all, to gratify Dundee. He sat for his
portrait at his own expense, gave it to the city, and, represented to
the life on canvas, felt at liberty to absent himself from the public
meeting at which the Lord Provost accepted the picture on behalf of
Dundee. Thus beyond the timorous Tweed do Merit and Modesty
dwell together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch,</span>&mdash;In your number of Oct. 5, "<span class="smcap">An Inconstant

correctly reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Mrs. Malaprop.</i> No caparisons, Miss, if you please. Caparisons don't
become a young woman.&mdash;<i>The Rivals</i>, Act IV., Sc. 2."</p>

<p>Young person, 23, short, dark, strict disciplinarian, wishes to correspond
with gentleman between 40 and 50, with view to matrimony.</p>

<p>What a "strict disciplinarian" to begin in this way. <i>And after?</i></p>

cricket season. Now he has "made a match" on the Matrimonial
Ground, and among the numerous presents received upon the
auspicious occasion that which, perhaps, is of most interest to the
"fastest trundler" takes the shape of a magnificent piano, the gift
of a "syndicate" of admiring friends. His favourite tune on a
winter evening will, of course, be "<i>Tom Bowling</i>"; and what more
appropriate, after some stirring anecdote relating to the "hat-trick,"
than a spirited "<i>Bolero</i>"? Then, too, music descriptive of a "leg-bye"
may surely be found among <span class="smcap">Pad-erewski's</span> compositions. By
the way, the Christian name of <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, as shared by <span class="smcap">Loates</span>, <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>,
